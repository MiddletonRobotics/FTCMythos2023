## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that was used for FTC Mythos 1369 during the CENTERSTAGE Season (2023-2024)

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio 2021.2 (codename Chipmunk) or later.

* First, if you have git installed on your system, clone the GitHub repository
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder and wait for the project to fully integrate.

Once the project has opened, you will have to navigate to the Constants class, and change the ID's of all of the Motors / Servos to what match's your Robot, as well as the functionality. Pretend this is a skeleton project.

After setup to your liking, you can connect your Android Device, or if you have a Control Hub, connect that to your computer, which then should pull up on the top right corner. Once connected, run the code and your good to go.
